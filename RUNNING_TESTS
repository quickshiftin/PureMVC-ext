this file contains a few notes about running unit tests on the pure_mvc extension

. runnig the included test suite
	. from the root of the pure_mvc extension execute:
		php run-tests.php tests

. note: if you encounter a warning about the TEST_PHP_EXECUTABLE environment variable
	"ERROR: environment variable TEST_PHP_EXECUTABLE must be set to specify PHP executable!"
	. under BASH, just export the path to the php binary you wish to use to execute the tests
	  a nice default is the php binary in your standard $PATH, which you can establish via
		export TEST_PHP_EXECUTABLE=`which php` 

. clean up: there is a special script which removes all files generated by run-tests.php
	. (again from pure_mvc root) run
		./cleantestdir.sh 
	  you should see a message:
		the 'tests' directory has been cleaned
