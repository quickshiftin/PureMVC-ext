coding
------
	. check all zend_class_entry* references, make sure we should be using puremvc_*_ce instead of zend_get_class_entry(getThis())
	. make logging method a macro so it doesnt slow shit down at runtime
	. go through and religiously add zval_dtor() calls & the like where applicable
	. wrap calls to puremvc_call_method in a macro, in case a later version adds more params to zend_call_method

	lower priority
	. try to limit use of pointers, eg. use zval this instead of zval *this
	. clean up all the comment blocks around the php-level methods
	. ?? change strlen(stringLiteral)+1 -> sizeof(stringLiteral)-1
	. add E_WARNING notices for all failures to zend_parse_parameters()

tests
-----
	. add non "happy path" tests, like testing hasProxy() when the proxy hasnt been registered
	. add the skipif bit to all the unit tests
